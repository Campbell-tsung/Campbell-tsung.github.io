The campus is huge and overwhelming. I saw so many people walking around with confident smiles, and I just felt like a deer in headlights. Tried to unpack and make my side of the room look less like a disaster zone. Dinner in the dining hall was… an experience. So many options, so many people, so much noise.

Chloe and I are starting to find a rhythm in the room; we mostly just exist together, but it's not bad. Everyone seems to be making friends so fast, and I'm still feeling like an outsider looking in. I went to a club fair and signed up for about ten different things, mostly out of panic. Maybe I'll actually go to one of them. Just feeling a bit… invisible right now.",

O-Chem already looks like a foreign language. I feel a bit more confident this time around, though. I know where things are, I have friends, and I know the dining hall best practices (always check the stir-fry line!).
